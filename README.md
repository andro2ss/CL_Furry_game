## General info

The goal of this project is to write a simple game in JavaScript ES6.

The protagonist of our game is **Furry**, who moves around a 10x10 field board.

On a random field of the board there is a coin. The player, controlling Furry with the keyboard arrows, must reach the coin. When he does, the coin disappears from the board and appears on another field, also random, and the player gets 1 point.

When the player hits the wall, the game ends: the board disappears and, as is common in computer games, the word "GAME OVER" appears.

At any point during the game, the player must see how many coins he has already collected.
